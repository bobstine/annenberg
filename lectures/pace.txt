2005 Schedule, in FairField Inn, Palm Desert

9-12, 1-2:30  9 days

Not for credit.  Very mixed bag of students, many of whom had taken
Paul Allison's categorical class first, and others who have never done
much stat.  Go figure.


Day	

1	Started off slow because had to rearrange room.  
	Got through the M&M experiment by lunch, but M&M not so needed
	because the new intro with rolling survey gets the ideas well.
	Used R to enter data, show results.

	Did lots more R in the afternoon, showing how to read data and
	generate plots, annotate plots

	Stopped at top of page 17, starting with CI.


2	R is hard for them to pick up, plus there are differences
	between the mac and pc version that are annoying. room hot.

	Stopped after page 11 in the morning, then picked up speed
	in the afternoon (they were dragging, so I went faster).  

	Got to page 15, the simple regression model.


3	R going along better, but still a bit rich for them to absorb.
	
	Stopped after going through the use of logs as transformation
	in simple regression, with focus on interpretations.

	Stopped at page 16, start of the Leinhard assignment question.
